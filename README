Using Beautiful Soup to mine video game reviews

I'm exploring some methods of scraping with Beautiful Soup and Selenium
This is not the fastest, or the best implementation. 
This same process can be done with only one of those two tools and could probably be done faster using 
xpath instead of searching inside the objects for example, but I wanted something different :)
